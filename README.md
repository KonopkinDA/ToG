Tale of Ghosts is a first-person RPG in a dark fantasy setting. The basic concept of the game is to provide the player, through magic, with a wide range of passage tools.

The game is in the early stages of development, and the code provided here is more of a field of experimentation in all areas of interaction with the Unreal Engine than an example of a complete architecture.
Nevertheless, several interesting modules are implemented inside, using C++, such as a master-system for animation or a smart sword collision handler

Despite the existence of the blueprints system inside Unreal Engine - all the project code is written in pure C++ (using Rider), as it allows to customize components much more flexible (and it's a lot more fun)
