Tale of Ghosts is a first-person RPG in a dark fantasy setting. The basic concept of the game is to provide the player, through magic, with a wide range of passage tools.

The game is in the early stages of development, and the code provided here is more of a field of experimentation in all areas of interaction with the Unreal Engine than an example of a complete architecture.
Nevertheless, several interesting modules are implemented inside, using C++, such as a master animation system or a smart sword collision handler
